##Location
Traditionally a mountain race, the Dung Orcs recieved their moniker from the Goblins who would laugh and enslave them. The Dung Orcs went north and west, populating the high mountains as well as the edges of the Great Chasm. They actually are populated among even the north and have made dealings with the Epuan empire in the west. 

##Politics/Culture
The Dung Orcs, or True Orcs as they like to be called, are a tribal race or people. Originally horse-back riders, they began training and riding Griffins when the Griffins started to hunt down their horses. The lifestyle of Dung Orcs is very solitary. A Griffin bonds for life with a master, so when an Orc reaches his age of adolescence, he is given a Griffin Egg. His right of passage into adulthood comes from raising his Griffin into adulthood as well, and succeffully performing a hunt, alone, without the tribe. Each adolescent performs his right of adulthood on the same day, the first day of winter. 

Because an Orc is very attached to his Griffin, many outside races have jokingly called it a marriage, and in Orc tongue, they would be right. An Orc does not take a wife, instead the fittest of Orc men and women will engage in the Dance of Shic-Talah, which happens on the coldest night in the great tent. When spring comes, a child is born, and is raised by the entire tribe. If anyone is to be considered an Orc's husband or wife, it is their Griffin.

It is said even, that in the most traditional of Orc tribes, that if a Griffin or Orc should die, their partner will die alongside it. Many Orcs still perform this, less out of tradition, and more out of pragmatism. If an Orc has no Griffin, after having ridden it for 40 years, he has no purpose left to the tribe, and should die with his partner. Should an Orc die before his Griffin, the Griffin is likely to become violent, and ill-tempered, refusing to be ridden by anyone else, making it necessary to put down the Griffin, for the safety of the tribe. 

##Races
* Humans: The humans do not bother the Orcs that much, they occasionally do business, but for the most part, the Orcs see the southern Humans as easy pickings, and the Northern Humans as even easier pickings. They do have a great deal of Respect for the Epuan Humans of the West though. 
* Half-Ogres: The Dung Orcs see the human in Half-Ogres to be a weakness and often see them as nothing more than burly humans
* Ogres: The Dung Orcs see true Ogres as lazy weaklings that turn into the most terrifying enemy if they have the chance. 
* Northern Goblins: They try to apologize and make ammends for their long history, but the Dung Orcs tend to just keep away.
* Southern Goblins: They still think of themselves as the rightful masters of the Dung Orcs, and their tongues will make good soup. 
* Divine Orcs: Their cousins in the sky. Many Dung Orcs find themselves jealious of their flying brothers, as they were able to escape the Goblin enslavement before them. But they are on positive opinions. Often the two tribes will hunt together when their lands cross. 
* Mountain Harpies: a friend to the Dung Orcs. While not as close as the Sky Harpies are to their cousins, They treat each other alright. The Fung Orcs just have to make sure their Griffins won't try to eat them. 
* Sky Harpies: The Dung Orcs feel pretty angry, but since many Sky Harpies are just as guilty about being unable to save them from the Goblins as they were angry at them for it, they eventually pushed their hatred solely at the Southern Goblins. 
* Wood Nymphs: Sexy women in the woods, but the Ogres tend to protect them. 
* Water Nymphs: Sexy women in the water, but they dive too deep to catch. 
* Stone Nymphs: Sexy women in the mountains, finally a woman they can have fun with
* Sky Nymphs: Sexy women in the sky, eh, they'll leave them to their cousins. 
* Half-Nymphs: Humans got to get freaky with the nymphs? why'd the whimpy humans get to do that?
* Halflings: Those annoying little brats should just leave them alone, or they'll be fed to their griffins
* Forrest Gnomes: They make cool tricks with their illusions, but in the end, they aren't a threat
* Deep Gnomes: They do good business with them, building them good weapons for them to use in exchange for their services.
