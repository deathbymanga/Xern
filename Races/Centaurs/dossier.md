#Centaurs
*Authors: Sebastian*

##Location
Centaurs live along islands and the sandy coasts of Xern, removing themselves as far from the magic of the forests as they can. Their homes are expertly crafted and designed to perfectly suit the Centaur way of life. Rooms are typically twice as big as other races keep them and with three times as much room since the Centaur has such a long body to work with. 

Major Centaur civilizations have marked key islands as major points in their society. These are called Centaur Isles by other nations and races. Whenever a major political decision needs to be made, the Centaurs will call a meeting at their respective Isles. Should a decision demand an even bigger group decision than just one Isle, they will call for a Grand Commune, where they will meet on the Isle of Viumis, a state-sized Island where they will all meet together. 

##Politics/Culture
Centaurs are creatures of logic and science. Because half-breed creatures like Centaurs are born from magical Love Lakes, the Centaurs believe that they are beings of magic. Because of this, they see it as illogical for a Centaur to use magic itself. It is considered blasphemy for any Centaur to be caught studying the arcane arts or being a follower of a divine path. To a Centaur, col, hard science is all they need. 

Centaurs keep an almost communistic life-style in their homes. if something needs to be built in a Centaur community, the group will decide on a project leader to hand the task, typically the smartest in the group, and the Centaurs involved in the task will follow. Most Centaurs are very rigid in their beliefs, with structure and safety being a powerful tool in their lives. Whenever a major political decision is made, the Centaurs will gather at a Centaur Isle or even at the Isle of Viumis. Should a decision require such an immense decision, it will take months to all gather and make a decision. 

Centaurs are known for being fast at performing an action, but comically slow at deciding on an action. Because Centaurs maintain a commune-lifestyle, they always make sure that everyone's voice is heard in order to make a fair and concise decision. 

Most Centaurs avoid man-to-man combat when they get involved in a fight. Because of their irregular frame, traditional combat is very hard to follow. Almost every Centaur army relies heavily of the Cavalry charge, using arrows and lances to sweep through the enemy. Because of this, Centaurs have been unopposed on the flat beaches of Xern where they live. Almost no other race even tries to invade their territory. The speed of a Centaur's hooves and the aim of their bows in unmatched in combat. 

Centaurs are known for expanding the realm of science beyond any race, having cracked the secrets of gunpowder and chemistry, and advanced forms of architecture and engineering. Whenever another civilization needs something important built or developed for them, the Centaurs are the first to come to them. 

##Races
* Humans: Humans and Centaurs are as close as brothers in Xern. whenever a human colony teams up with a centaur colony, you can expect something is going to happen. The humans benefit greatly from the Centaur's intelligence and ingenuity. While the Centaurs benefit from the human's decisiveness and flexible nature. 
* Half-Ogres: To a Centaur, a Half-Ogre is just as bad as an Ogre, with all the negative traits of a human combined. 
* Ogres: To a Centaur, an Ogre is nothing more than a stupid brute. They can't seem to speak right and they are so obsessed with the magical world around them. The two races are always at odds and often get into skirmishes all the time.
* Goblins: Goblins tend to avoid the Centaurs for good reason since no invading army has ever stood a chance against the centaurs on their home-turf. To Centaurs, Goblins are cruel and vicious, but harmless to anyone who can stand up to them.  
* Orcs: Despite the Centaur's opinions of the Goblins, the Centaurs ironically are the second biggest owners of Orc slaves. The Centaurs see it as pointless to try and reverse what the Goblins did and instead decided to make the best out of this situation. 
* Harpies: Harpies and Centaurs almost never cross paths, so they have very little opinion of each other.  
* Nymphs: The Centaurs and Nymphs can agree on many things thanks to their similar mind-set, but they rarely get along when it comes to magic. So friendly relations tend to stay neutral. 
* Half-Nymphs: To many Centaurs, Half-Nymphs are nothing more than  overly attractive humans. 
* Halflings: Halflings are the biggest annoyance to any Centaur. they come into Centaur territory all the time and just seem to cause problems all the time, and then disappear whenever they want. 
* Gnomes: Gnomes and Centaurs are often the best of friends, but the Centaurs seem to hold a little contempt for their Halfling friends due to their talent for magic. To a Centaur, Gnomes are waisting the potential and brilliant minds playing with such petty tricks. 

##Classes
* Barbarian: For the logic oriented Centaur, the Barbarian seems an awfully hard class to pick, however many Centaurs add a class or two of  Barbarian with their Fighter to make their lancing charge all the more sweat.  
* Bard: While the College of Lore sounds perfect for the Centaur, their over-abundance of Magic makes it very hard to find anything that they can use among this class. 
* Fighter: The Centaur Fighter is not a very common Fighter. Most Centaurs prefer to lance and charge their enemies, gripping a spear or a glaive and charging at the enemy without pause. 
* Ranger: One of the most common classes among Centaurs, the bow of the Ranger means that they don't need to use any uncomfortable close-range combat. Though the animal companion tends to be a bit hard to follow for the Centuar. 
* Rogue: The stealth of the Rogue seems hard to accomplish when you physically cannot crouch down. Many Centaurs tend to avoid this class, though the ones who do join tend to multi class with another. 
* Monk: Not many Centaurs care for the Monk class. Their horse bodies aren't fit for most martial art styles. However, those Centaurs who do practice the style tend to have the most deadly of any kick. Though the Elemental Fist is grounded upon, Centaurs can at least tell the difference between Magic and Ki and tend to look the other ways about using the magic within. 
* Paladin: Centaurs despise using magic, even when it is coupled with such nice armor
* Cleric: Centaurs despise using magic, even divine, and any church built on Centaur land is quickly dismantled. 
* Druid: Centaurs despise using magic
* Sorcerer: Centaurs despise using magic, and any sorcerer found in their community is immediately exiled. 
* Wizard: Centaurs despise using magic
* Warlock:  Centaurs despise using magic
