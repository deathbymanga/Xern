#Ogres

##Location
Ogres live in dense forests for the most part and find their tribes built closest to areas where magic flourishes the most. their homes are made from shattered trees that they break with their bare hands, but most tend to use the trees that are long since past their prime, killing the weak old trees to allow for young new trees to flourish. 

##Politics/Culture
Ogres chiefs are typically Paladins due to their discipline and focus. Most Ogre tribes get involved in at least one or two wars every generation due to their conflicts with other tribes and races. Every Ogre is raised to express their emotions with the utmost openness, so when an Ogre has their feelings hurt, they strike first and apologize later. 

Most Ogres are not Academics, seeing study to be a wasted effort. Any Ogre who seeks knowledge need only live and gain it. Because of this, most Ogres are low in Intelligence, but moderate in wisdom. Ogres see the entire world through symbolism, so the talk to one another through poetry. This rhyme-talk and low-intellect often leads Ogres to be perceived as stupid, but they do not care. 

Ogres are farmers/herders mostly, but they are notorious artisans. However, Ogres have a shifted definition of beauty and find themselves making strange abstract blobs that other races think hideous instead of works of art that sell. To an Ogre, the smell of an Onion is as sweet as a Rose and a Rose stinks of odour. 

Ogre beauty transcends to their women and mating also. Smooth, pale complexions seem weird to an Ogre as the scars and scabs on a person’s face tell so many stories. To an Ogre, a beautiful woman is one whose face tells a hundred stories. Because of this, most Ogres, upon meeting for the first time, will stare at each other’s faces for hours, reading each other’s stories and learning about one another

##Races
* Humans: Humans and Ogres do not get along for the most part, but they don’t outright hate each other either. Most humans will hide their disgust of Ogres out of fear of getting punched. 
* Half-Ogres: Half-Ogres who are raised in Ogre tribes are treated as nothing but normal Ogres. Many Ogres end up putting half-Ogres in positions as diplomats with humans or end up sending them to learn new skills out in the world. Half-Ogres raised by humans are looked at with pity since most half-Ogres serve as soldiers or gladiators of humans.
* Centaurs: Centaurs and Ogres do not like each other at all. Almost all Ogre wars have involved Centaurs on the other end. Centaurs live their lives removed from magic and see the Ogres as imbeciles who can’t do the basic of math, while Ogres see Centaurs as ignorant asses who have rejected the very soul of the earth in favour of academics.  
* Goblins: Goblins fear the Ogres and have tried to strike them when they are perceived weak, but most Ogres never bother with Goblins unless they are throwing Orcs at them. Goblins often are seen as mean and liars who can’t hold a promise to save their life. 
* Orcs: Ogres look to Orcs with sadness and Pity. They wish there was a way to save the Orcs from their slavery, but sometimes the Ogres remember the bullies the Orcs were before and think it is just fine the way it is. Either way, without the Goblins, the Orcs are harmless
* Harpies: Harpies have tried several times to ally with Ogres, but their interests are very limited. the Harpies are focused on population growth, and while the Ogres want to help, the Ogres and Harpies are too incompatible to breed. The Harpies and Ogres have agreed to a truce, should the Goblins ever engage a nearbye Harpie tribe, the Ogres will help, and should the Centaurs attack a nearby Ogre tribe, the Harpies will help. 
* Nymphs: The nymphs are considered the Ogre’s cousins or little sisters. Both worship the Archfeys and both live in nature, but neither are perfect for one another. The Nymphs are too connected to Nature to care for the animals and the Ogres are too brutish and emotional to only care about the forest. For the most part, the two races agree to stay friends and let that be that.
* Half-Nymphs: The Ogres feel for the Half-Nymphs who live among their Nymph mothers. Most Half-Nymphs can’t share their mothers’ devotion to nature since they aren’t as connected. Many Half-nymphs grow to consider the Ogre’s their aunts and uncles, living with them as much as they live with the Nymphs. Half-Nymphs who live among humans share some of the sympathy that Ogres give, but most are seen as just attractive humans. 
* Halflings: Halflings are good friends to Ogres, their childish lifestyles and friendliness is a good change of pace from the seriousness of the other races. Halflings often play the role of support class for Ogres, helping each other out. The Halflings can see an advantage to having such brutish friends on their side. 
* Gnomes: Gnomes and Ogres don’t associate much. Gnomes live underground and focus on Academics. But unlike the Centaurs, the Gnomes still practice magic and enjoy discussing magic with Ogres. Ogres and Gnomes are the most magically inclined and therefore make great allies in that trade, but the Gnomes don’t seem to care to explore their friendship as much as the halflings do. 

##Classes
* Barbarian Almost every Ogre has at least one level in Barbarian, and this typically is their first class as a child. Most Ogres remain as Barbarians and serve as Ogre soldiers in battles when not farming. 
* Bard Since the Ogre dialect is built on poetry, almost all Ogres enjoy music and song, but because of an Ogre’s giant hands, and large strength, most Ogres limit themselves in the Bardic class. Many Ogres who become Bards use a woodwind instrument and use a longsword instead of a rapier. 
* Fighter Very few Ogres find themselves as Fighters. Fighters require too much discipline and focus and since most Ogres become Barbarians anyway, the fighter is just pointless. Many Half-Ogres may choose the Fighter class, but not many Ogres care for it. 
* Ranger the second most common melee class. Many Ogres live in the dense forests as they commune with nature and the Ranger’ is the perfect class for that. The hunter, the beast tamer. Both versions fit at home among the Ogres. 
* Rogue With the Ogre’s giant size and thick limbs, the nimble and stealthy Rogue is not a favoured class of the Ogres. Though some dastardly Ogres may add a class if only to learn poisons. 
* Monk Some Ogres become Monks, but unlike many races, an Ogre Monk will simply swing their fists wildly like a drunken savage, not minding for the sophistication that many races follow. 
* Paladin often becoming chiefs and generals of Ogres, this is due to the divine faith of the Paladin giving the Ogre more discipline and control than most Ogres. 
* Cleric Like the Paladin, these Ogres often become leaders of Ogres, with Clerics becoming teachers and healers among Ogre tribes. 
* Druid The second most common kind of spellcaster, Druid Ogres are prominent casters among Ogres. Their knowledge of nature often leads them to becoming spiritual leaders in the absence of a Cleric. 
* Sorcerer The most common caster class among Ogres, the Ogres see Magic as a natural force that breaths from an Ogre’s lips, so to be a Sorcerer is to simply be exercising that natural right. 
* Wizard The least common class out of any, Ogres see magic as a natural force like gravity and air and blood, and to focus too much time trying to study it is a wasted effort. Many Ogres who are Wizards are seen as abnormal. 
* Warlock Ogres who become Warlocks are rare, but only because most Warlocks are rare anyway. Ogres who do become warlocks, typically become Archfey Warlocks, worshiping whatever Archfey their tribe followed to begin with.
