#Sky Harpies
*Authors:  Sebastian*

##Location
The Sky Harpies are found on floating islands, where they isolate themselves from the rest of the world, alongside their kin, the Divine Orcs. Sky Harpies build nests for themselves along the bottom of the islands. 

##Politics/Culture
Sky harpies are the offspring between Storks and humans, the divine blood of the Stork flowing through the body while the human mind sees different ways that power can be used. Sky Harpies are predominantly benevolent, seeing the world from above gives them a different light to how this world is. 

Many young Sky Harpies go off on journeys of self-discovery, serving the rest of the world and learning more about it. Harpies do not shy away from mating with the birds around them. Being born from birds, a Harpy may even fall in love with one. 

##Races
* Centaurs: Often the two do not get along very well. The Centaurs' strong anti-magic and faith views make then hard for the heavily religious Harpies to talk to. 
* Humans: Harpies find the Humans to be desirable, but not completely familiar. Many Harpies are looked at with prying eyes by the humans, and it makes them plenty uncomfortable. 
* Half-Ogres: Harpies see the Ogre as a similar case to themselves. seen as monstrous by their human counterparts. 
* Ogres: Ogres are a strange but pleasant race to be around. Many Ogres see the Harpy as a funny little creature, able to be so connected to Divine magic, and the Harpy admires the connection the Ogre has to pure Arcane magic as well. 
* Northern Goblins: Not much is felt for them. They tried to listen to the arguments about their slaves, but they still seem dangerous for their power hunger. 
* Southern Goblins: The dangerous ones. Many Harpies find themselves hunted by Goblins for sport. This animosity is often rare for other races. 
* Dung Orcs: A sad race to Harpies. Many Sky Harpies look at the enslaved Dung Orcs and wish they could have saved more before this all got out of hand. 
* Divine Orcs: A brother race to a Harpy. Since the Harpies bred with Orcs and made them, many Divine Orcs and Sky Harpies even form marriages of their own. 
* Mountain Harpies: The nasty cousin of the Sky Harpies. Many sky Harpies see them with distrust and worry. They do not know what side they stand on. 
* Wood Nymphs: Not too related
* Water Nymphs: Not too related
* Stone Nymphs: Not too related, many Stone Nymphs are more related to Gnomes and Mountain Harpies. 
* Sky Nymphs: Worry and fear. They are getting too violent and dangerous, it is likely that they will start something they cannot stop soon. 
* Half-Nymphs: Not too related
* Halflings: They enjoy the fun that the Halflings bring to the table, but worry that they can't be serious sometimes.
* Gnomes: Sometimes the get along, sometimes they don't. The Gnomes tend to bring a different perspective that the Harpy can respect, but their focus on exploration and scientific discovery makes it difficult for the patient Harpy to keep up with every time. 

##Classes
* Barbarian: the Barbarian is not an Obvious class, but it is an interesting one. The Focus on rage and power over armor and blade makes it ideal for the nimble Harpy. It is a humorous tail for a Harpy Barbarian, in their heavy rage, will grab an enemy and hurl them into the air to fall to their death. 
* Bard: An ideal class for any Harpy. The entertainers of the world commonly find the voice of a harpy to be a beautiful one and welcome in any circle. and the Jack-of-all-trades nature of the Bard means the Sky Harpy will always find some way to help.
* Fighter: Any Harpy who becomes a fighter is a rare one. Their limited armor and strength makes close-combat hard, but it is not impossible. Some harpies become famous for diving out of the sky and driving a great sword into their enemy's head. 
* Ranger: The Ranger is an ideal class for the Harpy. Their areal movement and flexibly legs makes sky archery a nasty skill to possess for them. Many Harpies end up becoming romantically involved in their avian companions as well. 
* Rogue: While the devious nature is not innate in all Harpies, some Harpies do not mind taking this path in their lives.
* Monk: It is very rare to find a monk Harpy. Their bodies are not the strongest, but speed and sharp claws mean that the Harpy is a difficult foe to face, especially when in the air. 
* Paladin: While the Paladin would be an ideal class, the Sky Harpy's awkward frame makes the armor of the Paladin difficult to wear. Many Paladin Harpies rely on ranged combat. 
* Cleric: Their divine blood makes Cleric an ideal class for Sky Harpies, many sky harpies take on this class.
* Druid: The second idea class for a Sky Harpy. Many Harpies use the Druid Wild sHape power to turn into monstrous birds like Rocs to destroy enemies. 
* Sorcerer: Not an uncommon class, not not overly desired, though it is the preferable alternative to wizard.
* Wizard: Due to needing to carry a spell book, most Harpies do not become Wizards. 
* Warlock:  Being born from Storks, the Sky Harpy refuses to become any Warlock outside of an Archfey. The powers of Fiends/Demons and Old Ones are not welcome among Harpies.
