decades after the fall of the Goblin Empire, the First Emperor was born in the mountains of what's today's Sun Region
nobody remembers what his name was 
He was born with magical powers, meaning he was most likely as Sorcerer (probably a Storm Born, or a Wild Magic type)
Thanks to his rare magical abilities, as well as his immense intellect and charisma, he first united the city states in his area, and then went on to unite all the other humans in the west, both by force and by diplomacy. The biggest resistance came from the militant city states of that's present day Jaguar region (Tupac's home) and the warrior culture following city states of today's Eagle region 
(there's a difference between "militant" and "warrior culture" here - the Jaguar people were kinda like Spartans, with everyone being a soldier, while the Eagle people were like feudal Japan, ruled by a warrior caste bound by honor and tradition)
Upon bringing all the humans in the west under his rule (he would have wanted to united all the humans in the world, but the mountains and the Trickster's Cradle would not allow him), he divided them into regions, based on culture, and had each region ruled by a governor he hand-picked from the locals, mostly to avoid conflicts arising from culture clash 
He then went on to establish piece with the other races. The Blackbacks were no problem. The Goblins begrudgingly agreed, after realizing they won't be able to re-establish their rule, and loosing a number of campaigns against Epua. With Stone giants a policy of mutual ignoring proved successful. However Trolls and Hill Giants have shown to be impossible to reason with, and continued to attack the human cities and villages. And so the First Emperor decided wipe them all out. 
Mind you, at this point the First Emperor was an elderly man, and he spent most of his time with office work, so it was really the military that ended-up wiping out the Hill Giants and Trolls in Epua, but the later re-tellings pretty much make it seem like he lead the campaign himself. 
After dying of old age, and leaving a large number of potential heirs, he was mummified, and buried in a hidden tomb.

A number of emperors came after him, some more competent than others, but power struggles within the royal family, as well as among the governors lead to frequent civil wars. 
Eventually, 300 years after the First Emperor, one of his successors, I'll call him Chaski (Incan for messenger), established the Cult of the First Emperor 
Declaring that all magic comes from the Grand Fey (seeing how the majority of spell-casters were Clerics or Warlocks), and that the Emperor is the Grand Fey's representative, as they are the heir of the Grand Fey's chosen (he basically interpreted the First Emperor's magical abilities as a gift from the Grand Fey herself)
He also established the Light Clerics as a sort of Inquisition (seeing how he was a Light Cleric himself)
This proved to work, seeing how despite they were still occasional civil wars, the people proved to be allot more willing and dedicated to side with the Emperor 

400 years after Emperor Faith Giver's reign, Epua was trading with the East, exchanging its huge surplus of gold (which the Epuans themselves didn't see much use for, aside for ritual and decorative purposes) and other goods (like chocolate, or exotic fruits and animal furs), for iron and other foreign goods (like sheep and donkeys, which eventually became widespread in Epua as well, so in the present day they are no longer traded; horses were and still are traded as well, but they are just kept as pets by the elites, as horses aren't suitable for Epua's terrains) 
With this trade, information on Arcane magic began spreading to Epua, and the local system became worried it may undermine the Emperor's authority, and thus the nation's stability.
And so eventually, the Emperor, let us call him Qasi (quiet in Inca), began confiscating all tomes of Arcane magic that made it into Epua, and storing them in a forbidden section of the Royal library 

3 centuries later, and we are in the present day, Emperor Kanan ("now" in Inca) rules
If I based the First Emperor on Gilgamesh and Alexander the Great, then Kanan would be based on the Holy Roman Emperor Josef II. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Iâ€¦
Emperor Kanan is still a relatively young ruler, but very skilled and VERY ambitious. 
He basically rules Epua as a benevolent, enlightened tyrant, and wishes to turn Epua into a global power by introducing many new technologies from the centaurs, and generally gathering all knowledge he can get his hands on. 
He even began studying Arcane magic, and established a wizard academy in the royal library, using all the arcane tomes his predecessors confiscated, and created a personal army of wizards all concentrated on his royal court. 
Kanan himself is a wizard (Divination School, as it allows him to personally keep an eye on his Empire), alto nobody in Epua is aware of it at the moment.
