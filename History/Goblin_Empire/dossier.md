2 thousand years ago, the Goblins and Orcs began to band under the authority
of Yule, a great and mighty Orc, who conquered the Goblins and lead his people
to grow and become more powerful. Their war started in the East of Xern, with
Yule slowly taking in more and more Goblins and Orcs into his army.
 
Years past and Yule had grown old. In his quest for power and unity, he failed
to provide an heir, and his people began to worry about what was going to
happen next. 

At his funeral, Yule's retainer, a young Goblin named Mitt, ready his master's
last will. In it, it read that Yule had declared Mitt to be his heir, much to
the surprise of his Orc comrades. Mitt began to solidify his rule as king and
began a power switch, instating many Goblins and replacing Orcs in power.
Eventually Mitt began to grow in his power and took many wives to secure his
lineage. 

As the conquest began, Mitt would slowly take in the Ogres into his forces.
He made many trade agreemenets with them and solidified a true partnership
with them, with many Ogres even gaining office higher than any Orc. 

When Mitt's son, Re'Mit took power, he expanded farther than no other, his
military genius expanding thousands of miles of Xern under his rule. He took
the Gnomes and the Halflings and put them under his rule, but ultimately had
to leave the Harpies in the north alone, due to their mountainous geography
making it impossible to take power from them. 

The south soon solidified under Re'Mit's grandson, with the Goblin empire
becoming the largest empire Xern had even seen. And for a thousand years, the
Goblin Empire stood without equal, taking 3/4ths of Xern under its rule. 

Eventually, Mitt's bloodline ended and the Goblin empire started holding office
for a council to rule the empire, instead of one man. However, these plans
became difficult.

Rebellion in the north from the Human/Centuaur Alliance had cut deep into the
Goblin empire's treasury and many feared a 100% Goblin ruled Xern would never
come. 

Of course, that's not to say only Goblins ruled Xern at this time. The genius
Hepen, a Halfling who's cleverness was surpassed by only his lively spirit,
stood strong among the court, and began to try and use these trying times to
push his influence. He made a doctrine for the empire to start placing stricter
regulation on their slavery system. His reasoning was that so many slavers were
abusing their slaves with no just cause, and that the Orc slaves in
particularly were becoming less respected than the cattle they butcher. 

Many Goblin's refused to listen, but this led to some reforms, which irritated
many Goblins. Work of Hepen's deeds made many lower Halfling and Gnome
officials begin to think that they could strive for higher office, maybe even
reach the high councel like Hepen himself. 

Many Goblin lords and Slavers hated this and began trying to ruin Hepen's
position. But this only strengthened Hepen's other campaigns towards reforming
the government against Corruption within, and with every loss in the north,
many politicians began to keep out Hepen's councel for help. 

Hepen released a full manefesto, detailing 65 new rules to be made absolute in
the Goblin empire. 32 of them seems to specifically target slave owners and put
sever limitations on how a slave was to be treated by his master.
