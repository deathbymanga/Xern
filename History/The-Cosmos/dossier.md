Originally there was nothing but the Chaos, and the Demons, beings manifested from the chaos. Among the Demons was the Archfey, who isolated itself from the rest of the Demons in the cosmic void of chaos. It managed to create a bubble of its own, but grew lonely. Not wanting to return to the other Demons, it instead divided itself into 5 beings: Light, representing it's desire for Order and control, moulded stars out of the chaos and took charge of the cosmos. 

The Mother, the Archfey's love and tolerance, as well as guilt and pain, began creating life, holding planets and filling the planets with new organisms. When an organism died, its spiritual energy returned to the cosmic void where it was protected and guarded by the Light.

Trickery, representing the Archfey's distrust of the other Demons, as well as its desire for more, began filling ideas and desires inside the minds of organisms, creating those with the passion to become more than what they were. The mindless apes and other organisms became the starting point for the races. And while the organisms thought and dreamed, Trickery found his home inside those dreams, an infinite cosmos, larger than even the Archfey's true home.

Nature and Weather established themselves as the rules of what they felt was most natural. Weather was the little trust that the Archfey had, as well as its guidance and foresight. He could see what the other aspects couldn't. He began to hold fate itself, commanding the weather and began isolating himself from the other aspects, preparing for what he knew what was to come.

Nature instead found herself more at home in the worlds that the Mother left alone. The Mother just cared for creating, and then watching for her creations to be no more. Nature loved to interact, to shape, to change, to experiment. Nature was Experience itself. She would actually tear off pieces of herself, mould them into mortals, and send them to worlds to learn and experience.

One of those experiences led her to finding War. War was the greatest warrior ever found. He loved combat more than anything. He met Nature during one of her quests, and she eventually showed him the rest of the cosmos. When he died, he refused to go to the Light and rest his soul in peace. Instead, he traveled to new worlds, his soul so strong it could manifest on any plane without any effort, and he fought and killed millions. The Gods needed to find a solution to War's problem. 

Trickery saw War's actions and became amused by them, then intrigued, until he and Nature, who had caused this problem, wanted to see what more he would do. Mother and Light on the other hand, wanted War to just die already, Light himself wanted to destroy War because he refused to accept his death. 

Then Weather showed up as the tie-breaker and tossed his vote with Trickery and Nature, refusing to say his reason. With the vote 3-2, War wasn't allowed to die, so they needed a new idea. Mother created a large world, all for War to kill and slaughter. His only return for this, was that he become a God like them, and now and then train their mortals in combat so that the fighting became even more exciting. 

The last of the Gods to show was Knowledge, grown from experience. Trickery saw the potential of mortals from War and began to look for more fun. Eventually he came across a young woman. Her dreams and desires were so exciting and creative, that he never found enough of them. Eventually he fell in love with her. In the realm of dreams they made love, and Knowledge was born, born from Trickery's own mind. 

Knowledge was born, more accepting of others ideas and open to sharing than her father, Knowledge cared little about power and more about change and growth. She was always studying what the other gods had made and trying to make her own versions. She would occasionally share this knowledge with mortals, being one of the favourites of scientists and the Centaurs. Many races actually depict Knowledge as a Centaur, just by how common she is worshiped by them. 

These 7 became the most powerful beings in Archfey's world. Until their happenings drew the attention of outsiders. 

Demons, like the Archfey itself, became interested in the worlds that they had created, and wanted them for their own. They broke through the bubble and pushed the 7 Aspects out, taking the worlds for their own. 

After Light left, the souls had no protection, becoming corrupted by the chaos and the Demon's own energy. They became lesser demons, serving the wills of those who corrupted them. 

The only Aspect to not vanish, was the Trickster, who stayed in the realm of dreams, away from any Demon. 

The Demons began to play with their spoils. One demon began enamoured with a world the Mother and Nature had found most enjoyable to make, Xern. He spent so much time observing and playing with it, the Demons renamed him X(E/R)^N. He tried to take Xern for himself by sending lesser demons inside, but the power and beauty would have vanished if X(E/R)^N destroyed what wasn't his. So he compromised, and created some of his own life, and send demons to care for it. 

The Demons entertained each other by gambling, making bets and challenges. It was an unspoken rule that cheating was the intended goal, but if you got caught cheating, you were severely punished. 

One day, X(E/R)^N got caught cheating badly, for punishment, the Demons sealed him inside Xern, letting his magic strengthen the world and keep it alive.
