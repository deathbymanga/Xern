(09:56:44 PM) ***Foxwarrior fidgets with that letter
(09:56:56 PM) Steveaccounting: "Whats it sayin'"
(09:57:12 PM) ***Foxwarrior tosses it up in the air, giving it a good spin, and catches it again
(09:57:22 PM) Foxwarrior: "It's some sort of rectangle"
(09:57:23 PM) Steveaccounting: "Dude..."
(09:57:25 PM) Foxwarrior: "I don't think it talks"
(09:57:28 PM) Steveaccounting: "Gimme."
(09:57:35 PM) ***Steveaccounting opens the letter
(09:57:38 PM) Foxwarrior: "Uh, sure, if you want it"
(09:57:47 PM) ***Steveaccounting reads
(09:57:55 PM) DM_Meaty: (You notice that the letter had an incredibly ornate wax seal on it)
(09:58:01 PM) Steveaccounting: "No finance report. So it may not be a nightmare."
(09:59:26 PM) DM_Meaty: (Inside the letter, it seems to be from someone named Fink. It's a welcoming letter, telling Arren Witherstone (Steve) about how the King was looking forward to purchasing a couple of his leftover painting s after the gallery was done)
(09:59:42 PM) Steveaccounting: (fox is whitherstone)
(10:00:00 PM) DM_Meaty: (Sorry, i keep getting you confused for some reason)
(10:00:09 PM) DM_Meaty: (Probably because FOX isn't a name()
(10:00:22 PM) Steveaccounting: "Were supposed to sell paintings."
(10:00:27 PM) Steveaccounting: "Shitty quest."
(10:00:38 PM) ***Steveaccounting sifts through her bag, looking for a journal
(10:01:08 PM) DM_Meaty: (You also notice that Fink has mentioned something about securing Fox a room at the inn and that he had asked about securing him some "company" while he was in town)
(10:01:51 PM) Foxwarrior: "I've never sold a painting before, is it exciting?"
(10:01:59 PM) Steveaccounting: "No."
(10:02:13 PM) Steveaccounting: "Just numbers. Lots and lots of numbers. Not in this dream."
(10:03:05 PM) DM_Meaty: (You don't see anything resembling a castle though)
(10:03:43 PM) Steveaccounting: (???)
(10:03:52 PM) DM_Meaty: (Where the king would be)
(10:04:20 PM) ***Steveaccounting looks for a journal in "her" backpack
(10:04:40 PM) DM_Meaty: (The journals all seem to be filled with research notes on plants and wildlife)
(10:04:58 PM) ***Steveaccounting looks for something resembling a quest
(10:05:29 PM) DM_Meaty: (nothing but notes on different plants)
(10:05:50 PM) Steveaccounting: "Fuck."
(10:06:12 PM) ***Foxwarrior loads his crossbow and looks for birds
(10:06:29 PM) Steveaccounting: "Time to slay goblins I guess. Put that crossbow away."
(10:07:00 PM) DM_Meaty: (Steve notices that he doesn't actually know any spells)
(10:07:24 PM) ***Foxwarrior grudgingly puts his crossbow away
(10:07:29 PM) ***Steveaccounting inspects "his" notes far more intently
(10:07:36 PM) Steveaccounting: "I need spells...."
(10:08:10 PM) Foxwarrior: "What are 'spells'?"
(10:08:32 PM) Steveaccounting: "Better than a quarterstaff."
(10:08:40 PM) DM_Meaty: (Fox, you notice different kinds of plants appearing on the ground as Steve looks through the book)
(10:09:11 PM) Foxwarrior: "Plants grow really fast around here"
(10:09:20 PM) ***Steveaccounting looks down confused
(10:09:37 PM) DM_Meaty: (There appears to be an identical plant to the one you were just looking at)
(10:09:41 PM) Steveaccounting: "A nature wizard hooker? Why..."
(10:09:58 PM) ***Steveaccounting tries random gestures at the birds
(10:10:11 PM) DM_Meaty: (Nothing happens)
(10:10:23 PM) ***Steveaccounting tries to replicate the plants
(10:10:41 PM) DM_Meaty: (A second plant appears next to it)
(10:11:06 PM) ***Steveaccounting tries to plant violently at the birds
(10:11:24 PM) DM_Meaty: (what?)
(10:11:36 PM) Steveaccounting: (Hes getting desparate)
(10:11:43 PM) DM_Meaty: (what is he doing?)
(10:11:57 PM) Steveaccounting: (Trying spells)
(10:12:07 PM) DM_Meaty: (Plant violently?)
(10:12:14 PM) Steveaccounting: (He wants to kill stuff w/ plants)
(10:12:38 PM) DM_Meaty: (You notice a flower appears on a nearby bird, but it doesn't even notice it)
(10:13:18 PM) ***Steveaccounting sighs
(10:13:26 PM) ***Steveaccounting looks for a clothing shop
(10:13:46 PM) DM_Meaty: (You notice you don't have any money)
(10:13:55 PM) Steveaccounting: "Do you have moeny?"
(10:14:14 PM) Foxwarrior: "Have what?"
(10:14:27 PM) ***Steveaccounting describes money to him
(10:14:34 PM) Steveaccounting: (were on a bench rigth?)
(10:14:50 PM) DM_Meaty: (Fox seems to have 20 coins of different colors and sizes in his pockets)
(10:14:54 PM) DM_Meaty: (yes)
(10:15:00 PM) ***Foxwarrior pulls the coins out
(10:15:11 PM) ***Steveaccounting inspects them
(10:15:22 PM) DM_Meaty: (they all seem to be gold)
(10:15:43 PM) Steveaccounting: (numbers on them?
(10:16:08 PM) DM_Meaty: (No numbers, but they do seem to labeled "Under the authority of King Nubis)
(10:16:39 PM) ***Steveaccounting takes them and goes into a clothing shop
(10:16:50 PM) Steveaccounting: "Stay or come, I'll be back"
(10:17:15 PM) ***Foxwarrior follows Steve
(10:18:49 PM) DM_Meaty: (Ok, you go into the shop)
(10:19:06 PM) Steveaccounting: "Your most concealing robe"
(10:19:14 PM) DM_Meaty: (All the clothes seem very old. This entire town seems to be from the 14th century)
(10:19:43 PM) Steveaccounting: "Not too heavy cloth if possible. Black."
(10:20:02 PM) DM_Meaty: "Um, yes miss, one second."
(10:20:08 PM) DM_Meaty: (she notices Fox)
(10:20:22 PM) DM_Meaty: "OH! Mister Witherstone, I just loved your Gallery yesterday)\"
(10:21:13 PM) Foxwarrior: "Oh, did you? Very good"
(10:21:38 PM) Steveaccounting: "And a blouse and some pants."
(10:21:49 PM) ***Steveaccounting looks at her skin
(10:21:53 PM) DM_Meaty: "Pants?"
(10:22:02 PM) Steveaccounting: "Yeh. Listen, will you
(10:22:10 PM) DM_Meaty: "Miss, you are a nymph, yes?"
(10:22:36 PM) DM_Meaty: "I've never heard of a nymph wearing anything, less a pair of pants"
(10:22:46 PM) Steveaccounting: "Oh am I" I say, trying to pry for more information
(10:22:46 PM) DM_Meaty: "In fact, aren't you rather warm as it is?"
(10:23:08 PM) DM_Meaty: "I've never seen a normal human who looked as lovely as you do"
(10:23:15 PM) Steveaccounting: (what colour is my skin)
(10:23:34 PM) DM_Meaty: (White, but with brownish green hues)
(10:24:13 PM) Steveaccounting: "It's for a friend. And the robe should obscure the face somewhat well."
(10:24:36 PM) DM_Meaty: "Of course, I'm sorry for assuming"
(10:24:39 PM) Steveaccounting: (is the shop girl cute?)
(10:24:53 PM) DM_Meaty: (She makes her way into the back to get the clothes)
(10:25:05 PM) DM_Meaty: (Yes, she appears to be about a 7)
(10:25:15 PM) ***Steveaccounting imagines the girl naked while waiting
(10:25:17 PM) DM_Meaty: (You're a 10)
(10:26:25 PM) DM_Meaty: (She comes back with a nice linen cloak)
(10:26:40 PM) DM_Meaty: (And a pair of pants made out of very thin leather)
(10:27:37 PM) Steveaccounting: "Don't you have a robe, miss?" He asks trying to smile nicely
(10:27:41 PM) DM_Meaty: (You notice that while all of the clothes are very nice, they are all very clearly handmade, and not of the same structural quality you are used to)
(10:27:50 PM) DM_Meaty: (a cloak IS a rope)
(10:27:59 PM) DM_Meaty: (A cloak is a rope that covers the face)
(10:28:04 PM) DM_Meaty: *Robe
(10:28:05 PM) Steveaccounting: (Isnt it just headcovering and cape?)
(10:28:09 PM) DM_Meaty: (No)

(10:28:36 PM) DM_Meaty: "For your… friend?"
(10:28:42 PM) Steveaccounting: "yes."
(10:28:46 PM) DM_Meaty: "ok"
(10:28:58 PM) DM_Meaty: She walks back into the storeroom
(10:29:15 PM) ***Steveaccounting looks for a changeing cabin
(10:29:22 PM) DM_Meaty: (Fox are you doing anything?)
(10:29:42 PM) ***Foxwarrior is looking at the wares
(10:29:58 PM) DM_Meaty: (You see a lot of nicely embroidered clothing)
(10:30:24 PM) Foxwarrior: "You people sure put a lot of work into this clothing stuff"
(10:30:33 PM) Steveaccounting: "Yep."
(10:30:56 PM) ***Steveaccounting imagines the girl naked some more only to blush as she returns
(10:31:50 PM) DM_Meaty: The woman looks very nervous and awkward
(10:32:05 PM) DM_Meaty: (She notices a naked copy of herself posing rather lewdly)
(10:32:21 PM) DM_Meaty: "What is going on here?"
(10:32:31 PM) ***Steveaccounting stops instantly
(10:33:25 PM) DM_Meaty: (The copy begins to fade away)
(10:33:53 PM) Steveaccounting: When it's gone he asks "innocently" :"What do you mean, miss?"
(10:34:02 PM) Steveaccounting: And takes the blouse.
(10:34:18 PM) Steveaccounting: "Thank you."
(10:34:28 PM) Steveaccounting: (Any changeing rooms?)
(10:34:32 PM) DM_Meaty: "I saw that illusion, if you want to go about using magic at my expense then I'm not going to want to do any business with you"
(10:34:45 PM) DM_Meaty: (You were in the changing room, but the clone wasn't)
(10:35:07 PM) Steveaccounting: "Just say how much, please."
(10:36:02 PM) DM_Meaty: "3 gold for it all. Please leave"
(10:36:16 PM) ***Steveaccounting pays and leaves awkwardly
(10:37:27 PM) ***Foxwarrior follows Steve
(10:38:04 PM) ***Steveaccounting returns to the room with the halfling and changes into the clothes that obscure her somewhat
(10:38:22 PM) DM_Meaty: (Ok, you have new clothes, and you are ready to leave. What next?)
(10:38:38 PM) Steveaccounting: Practicing magic
(10:39:22 PM) ***Steveaccounting tries to get a grip on the illusions
(10:40:24 PM) DM_Meaty: (Ok, you notice that images that you think about form into being)
(10:41:05 PM) Foxwarrior: "If you're just going to sit around here making fake things, I'm going to go look for something to kill"
(10:41:11 PM) Steveaccounting: "I need more spells"
(10:41:29 PM) Steveaccounting: (I pack the leaf clothes into the backpack)
(10:42:13 PM) DM_Meaty: (ok)
(10:42:15 PM) Steveaccounting: "Where can we get more spells
(10:42:25 PM) DM_Meaty: (You notice that there don't seem to be any magic stores)
(10:42:41 PM) Steveaccounting: Maybe any mage towers?
(10:43:15 PM) DM_Meaty: (please note also that I am basically letting you use your Silent Illusions whenever.)
(10:43:24 PM) DM_Meaty: (There aren't any towers)
(10:43:48 PM) Foxwarrior: "What's all this about spells? Sharp teeth should be enough for anyone"
(10:43:56 PM) Steveaccounting: "Whats your deal dude"
(10:44:02 PM) Steveaccounting: "Who even are you"
(10:44:22 PM) Foxwarrior: "I'm Mister Wither...something"
(10:44:25 PM) Foxwarrior: "I think"
(10:44:33 PM) Steveaccounting: "That's clearly a lie."
(10:44:48 PM) Foxwarrior: "That's what the guy called me"
(10:44:55 PM) ***Steveaccounting checks the letter
(10:45:03 PM) Foxwarrior: "Unless you're the Mister Wither person"
(10:45:33 PM) Steveaccounting: "Mister is a guy word. I clearly have los my guy-ness."
(10:45:45 PM) Steveaccounting: *lost
(10:46:07 PM) Foxwarrior: "Is Steve a guy name then?"
(10:46:15 PM) Steveaccounting: "No shit."

(10:50:30 PM) Steveaccounting: "Like, howd you get here?"
(10:50:34 PM) Foxwarrior: "I was breaking into this guy's house because I thought I heard a hamster"
(10:50:48 PM) Steveaccounting: "What kind of psycho does that"
(10:51:22 PM) Foxwarrior: "I didn't find the hamster, but I walked on a table where there was some sort of glowing rectangle, and now I'm here"
(10:51:33 PM) Foxwarrior: "In this weird human body"
(10:51:41 PM) Steveaccounting: "Midget."
(10:51:56 PM) Steveaccounting: "Humans are bigger
(10:51:56 PM) Foxwarrior: "Is that what humans call each other?"
(10:52:04 PM) ***Steveaccounting tries to remember more
(10:53:53 PM) Foxwarrior: "Oh, that's why it seems like everyone is still taller than me"
(10:54:01 PM) Steveaccounting: "Yep."
(10:54:10 PM) DM_Meaty: (Fox, you notice the sound of construction work)
(10:54:58 PM) Foxwarrior: "Someone's destroying a log out there"
(10:55:18 PM) ***Steveaccounting goes to the window
(10:56:40 PM) DM_Meaty: (um, you guys were both outside)
(10:56:50 PM) Steveaccounting: (we returned for me to dress up)

(10:58:16 PM) Steveaccounting: (pracitesed)
(10:59:07 PM) DM_Meaty: (the sound seems to be coming from far away)
(10:59:28 PM) Steveaccounting: "Well. Being stuck here, we better sell some paintings."
(10:59:41 PM) Steveaccounting: "And get spells."
(10:59:46 PM) DM_Meaty: (You can follow the noise if you want)
(10:59:54 PM) ***Steveaccounting looks for a clerk-fetching bell and rings it
(11:00:08 PM) DM_Meaty: (There are no stores selling spells)
(11:00:27 PM) Foxwarrior: "I thought you said selling paintings wasn't exciting. Why should we do it?"
(11:00:41 PM) Steveaccounting: "Cause we're stuck here."
(11:01:49 PM) ***Steveaccounting rings the clerk-bell more
(11:02:16 PM) Foxwarrior: "We could be out killing birds and feasting"
(11:02:28 PM) DM_Meaty: (What store clerk are you talking to?

(11:03:10 PM) DM_Meaty: (the clerk shows up)
(11:03:17 PM) DM_Meaty: "Yes"?
(11:03:21 PM) Steveaccounting: "First of all, where do the wizards Reside?"
(11:04:09 PM) DM_Meaty: "Well, we have the Good Magician, but he lives separated from the rest of the world, and his castle isn't very easy to find"
(11:04:52 PM) DM_Meaty: "There's his majesty, the King, but he's more interested in politics, as is his brother, Sibun"
(11:05:32 PM) Steveaccounting: "Grand."
(11:05:47 PM) Foxwarrior: "So you think we could get some spells from the King in exchange for paintings, Steve?"
(11:05:55 PM) Steveaccounting: "Nah."
(11:06:16 PM) DM_Meaty: "Sorry, not many people are active practitioners of magic"
(11:06:30 PM) DM_Meaty: "We all use a little of it, but it's not a well practiced skill"
(11:06:55 PM) Steveaccounting: "Is there any word on how the painting exchange will be done?"
(11:06:59 PM) Steveaccounting: "Will the king visit?"
(11:07:01 PM) DM_Meaty: "You were making illusions right? Does that mean you're half-human?
(11:07:09 PM) DM_Meaty: "Is that your magic talent"?
(11:07:28 PM) Steveaccounting: "Maybe."
(11:07:42 PM) ***Steveaccounting despairs internally at the thought of maybe not even being a spellcaster
(11:07:55 PM) DM_Meaty: "Sorry, don't know anything about his majesty. You can find him by the construction site. He's trying to build a castle"
(11:08:27 PM) Steveaccounting: "You were very helpful. You can leave now."
(11:08:42 PM) DM_Meaty: "Um, this is where I work" 
(11:08:56 PM) Steveaccounting: "The room. You can leave the room."

(11:19:21 PM) Steveaccounting: "Maybe we should sit and listen in a tavern for a bit"
(11:19:39 PM) Foxwarrior: "Those horses are attached to humans somehow"
(11:19:41 PM) Steveaccounting: "You don't know anything about this world either, do you?"
(11:19:53 PM) Steveaccounting: "Centaurs. Classic greek"
(11:19:54 PM) Foxwarrior: "No, this world is pretty strange"
(11:20:04 PM) Foxwarrior: "What's Greek?"
(11:20:16 PM) Steveaccounting: "Where did you even go to school?"

(11:22:34 PM) Foxwarrior: "Let's go there, Steve"
(11:22:51 PM) Steveaccounting: (is the dragging away not working?
(11:23:05 PM) DM_Meaty: (Fox is stronger than you)

(11:28:43 PM) Steveaccounting: "If we're doing buisness here we need to know our way around more"
(11:28:57 PM) Foxwarrior: "We'd find something out if we visited the king"
(11:29:25 PM) Steveaccounting: "If the king notices we dont belong here tings could go REALLY BAD."
(11:29:55 PM) Foxwarrior: "Why?"
(11:29:56 PM) Steveaccounting: "So we should just hang out here for a bit and try to understand how the place works."
(11:30:11 PM) Foxwarrior: "Surely we could just kill him and hide the body"
(11:30:16 PM) Steveaccounting: "No."

(11:35:30 PM) Foxwarrior: "The best species in the world"
(11:35:44 PM) Foxwarrior: "You know"
(11:35:44 PM) Steveaccounting: "Dogs?"
(11:35:51 PM) ***Foxwarrior shudders
(11:35:54 PM) Foxwarrior: "Disgusting!"
(11:35:56 PM) Steveaccounting: "just say it dude"
(11:36:19 PM) Textmode [~boneidle@adsl-1-au-2-174.ozonline.com.au] entered the room.
(11:36:21 PM) Foxwarrior: "You would even think of dogs as a possibility?"
(11:36:45 PM) Steveaccounting: "No but I thought If I said dog you'd finally spit it out"
(11:36:54 PM) Foxwarrior: "They're vile mockeries of the perfect fox form"
(11:37:14 PM) Steveaccounting: "A fox. I'm here with a fox."
(11:37:32 PM) Steveaccounting: "Anyway. You'll probably like human food."
(11:38:06 PM) ***Steveaccounting orders steak for the halfling and something else for herself and nothing for the illusion
(11:38:07 PM) Foxwarrior: "Who knows, maybe this oddly shaped body has different taste buds"
(11:38:52 PM) cup_of_joe [~cup_of_jo@162.244.194.128] entered the room.
(11:39:12 PM) DM_Meaty: "The waiter brings a steak to you two"
(11:39:26 PM) Steveaccounting: And then we just sit and listen in on conversations around us to get an understanding of what is going on in this city.
(11:39:37 PM) ***Steveaccounting tries to keep the fox occupied w/ food
(11:39:44 PM) ***Foxwarrior tries the steak
(11:40:04 PM) Foxwarrior: "This stuff's pretty good"
(11:40:19 PM) Foxwarrior: "Whatever it is that was done to this meat"
(11:40:23 PM) DM_Meaty: (Ok, I want to eat (it's nearly 6 and i haven't had breakfast) and we've played for 3 hours, do you guys want to put this on hold for more?)
(11:40:29 PM) Foxwarrior: "It could do with more entrails though"
(11:40:49 PM) Steveaccounting: "I'm sure we can arrange that."
(11:41:07 PM) Steveaccounting: (Sure. When?)
(11:41:14 PM) Foxwarrior: (It hasn't been a full three hours yet, and if we stop I have errands that take an unknown amount of time to do)
(11:41:58 PM) DM_Meaty: (How about we play for half an hour more and continue this later?)
(11:42:07 PM) Foxwarrior: (sure)
(11:42:15 PM) Steveaccounting: (works)
(11:43:13 PM) DM_Meaty: (Ok, after waiting for half an hour at the restaurant, you get pushed out by the staff for hogging a table)
(11:43:29 PM) Foxwarrior: (did we hear anything informative first?)
(11:43:32 PM) Steveaccounting: (what did we gather in intel?)
(11:45:10 PM) DM_Meaty: (You know that you are in the land of Xern, and this city is called Roogna. You understand that humans are born with a unique magical talent that can range from changing the color of your lips to making entire trees grow in a mater of seconds.)
(11:45:26 PM) Steveaccounting: Also at some point I explain that I'll ask for magical instruction and money for the paintings.)
(11:45:36 PM) ***Foxwarrior wonders what his power is
(11:46:42 PM) Steveaccounting: And we go to get a painting and then to see the king
(11:46:45 PM) DM_Meaty: (The King is only "King" in title. Both Nibus and Subin are vying for the thrown and they seem to have made a deal. If Nibus can build his castle within the year, Nibus will be crowned king. If Subin stops him, Subin will be king)
(11:47:43 PM) DM_Meaty: (The centaurs have sided with Nibus, who promised to recognize their independence, so a large village of Centaurs have agreed to use their academic prowess to construct a very nice castle)
(11:49:03 PM) DM_Meaty: (No one seems to know where the Good Magician is, and he seems to be very important. He's known as the Magician of Information and seems to be able to solve anyone's problem if they come to him)
(11:49:52 PM) DM_Meaty: (There's been some rather serious in-fighting between the Goblins and Harpies and many concerned citizens are afraid war will break out between them)
(11:49:57 PM) DM_Meaty: (That's everything)
(11:50:27 PM) Steveaccounting: So we're going to sell nibus paintings.
(11:50:44 PM) Foxwarrior: "And then we'll sell Subin sabotage?"
(11:50:45 PM) DM_Meaty: (ok)
(11:50:58 PM) DM_Meaty: (what?)
(11:51:08 PM) Steveaccounting: "No. We won't get caught in a war."
(11:51:16 PM) Steveaccounting: "That gets you killed."
(11:52:00 PM) Foxwarrior: "We can hide"
(11:52:21 PM) Steveaccounting: "We can try to hide and probably still get killed."
(11:52:41 PM) Steveaccounting: "We need to find this good magician to get out of here
(11:53:42 PM) Foxwarrior: "So, wander around in the woods, looking for a castle?"
(11:54:16 PM) Steveaccounting: "We can do research or something. I don't know."
(11:54:46 PM) DM_Meaty: (Are you back at the construction site?)
(11:54:57 PM) Foxwarrior: "If only one of us could fly"
(11:55:13 PM) Foxwarrior: "It'd probably be a lot faster to find a castle that way"
(11:55:23 PM) Steveaccounting: (To the construction site with a painting, yes.)
(11:56:22 PM) DM_Meaty: (Trust me, it wouldn't be safe at all)
(11:56:47 PM) Steveaccounting: (flying or going to the construction site)
(11:56:54 PM) DM_Meaty: (flying)
(11:57:33 PM) DM_Meaty: (ok, you made it back to the construction site and you see a man, talking friendly with the Centaurs)
(11:57:59 PM) DM_Meaty: (He seems to be wearing some very nice clothes)
(11:58:23 PM) Foxwarrior: "Maybe that guy is looking for the king too"
(11:58:44 PM) Steveaccounting: We approach and via the illusory woman I say "Good day. We are looking to see the king about him acquireing paintings?)
(11:59:40 PM) DM_Meaty: "Welcome Mister Misterstone. I quite enjoyed your Gallery. You must promise to save one of these paintings for me after you are done with my brother)
(11:59:47 PM) DM_Meaty: *Witherstone
(12:00:36 AM) Foxwarrior: "Uh, sure"
(12:00:37 AM) DM_Meaty: "I'm Prince Subin
(12:01:00 AM) DM_Meaty: "I'm sure I can find many ways to make your stay as pleasant as it can be"
(12:01:50 AM) DM_Meaty: "My brother is still in his study, working out details with his Centaur friends"
(12:01:58 AM) Steveaccounting: "We appreciate the offer."
(12:02:54 AM) DM_Meaty: "But, if I were you, I'd stay a bit father away from the castle. Things aren't going to go well with my brother's latest plan"
(12:03:51 AM) Foxwarrior: "Ooh, is it going to explode?"
(12:04:15 AM) DM_Meaty: "No no no. Explosions are too dangerous. Might hurt someone. Don't want that."
(12:04:59 AM) Steveaccounting: "Thanks for the advice."
(12:05:26 AM) DM_Meaty: (You start to see several bricks spontaneously popping out of the walls of the construction site, landing all over the place, with the castle breaking apart)
(12:05:51 AM) ***Foxwarrior watches intently
(12:06:40 AM) Steveaccounting: "Where exactly are you staying?"
(12:07:23 AM) DM_Meaty: "Me? Why that'd be quite a secret to tell you, wouldn't it?"
(12:08:03 AM) DM_Meaty: "I mean, there's only 2 people in line for the thrown, imagine if something happened to me, my brother would actually stand a chance at winning"
(12:08:42 AM) Steveaccounting: "Then you sadly have to stop by if you wish to buy a painting. We hope it's not much of a bother."
(12:09:18 AM) DM_Meaty: Not at all. I'll send one of my scouts to go and purchase it from you when you have the time"
(12:09:39 AM) DM_Meaty: (Are you heading to the king?)
(12:09:59 AM) Steveaccounting: (If he doesnt look busy)
(12:11:11 AM) DM_Meaty: Do you head to his study?)
(12:11:43 AM) Steveaccounting: (Is there general caos after the castle breaking down?)
(12:13:13 AM) DM_Meaty: (For the most part, yes, but everyone seems very used to it. It's clear that this isn't the first time this has happened)
(12:13:33 AM) Steveaccounting: "Off to See Sir Nubin then."
(12:14:55 AM) Foxwarrior: "yes, let's"
(12:15:26 AM) DM_Meaty: (ok, as you open the door to the study, you see Nubis mulling over some plans for the castle)
(12:15:45 AM) DM_Meaty: (His advisor, a Centaur woman is with him
(12:15:46 AM) Foxwarrior: "Your castle broke"
(12:15:59 AM) DM_Meaty: "That's the fifth one this week"
(12:16:29 AM) Steveaccounting: "Sabotage?"
(12:16:34 AM) DM_Meaty: (You notice that the centaur woman doesn't have any clothes on. And upon observation, none of the centaurs seem to be wearing clothes)
(12:16:41 AM) DM_Meaty: "Most likely it was Subin"
(12:16:53 AM) DM_Meaty: (-Nubis)
(12:17:27 AM) DM_Meaty: (-Centaur) "Sir, perhaps my men and I should attempt to restrain your brother to prevent him from causing anymore trouble"
(12:17:59 AM) Steveaccounting: "Anyway. We're here about the paintings."
(12:18:15 AM) DM_Meaty: (-Nubis) "No no, that's not needed. Besides, it wouldn't end well with you guys. My brother is quite the dangerous man. Better to play his game and win than to try and fight him and loose"
(12:18:35 AM) DM_Meaty: (_Nubis) Ah yes, I believe I asked about those, can I see them?"
(12:19:06 AM) Steveaccounting: "We brought one."
(12:20:11 AM) Steveaccounting: (we show it)
(12:21:00 AM) DM_Meaty: "Hmm, yes, Quite lovely. I'll pay 25 gold for that one, is that a fair deal?"
(12:21:25 AM) Steveaccounting: (Wouldn't a famous artist get waaaay more?)
(12:21:38 AM) Foxwarrior: (how would you know?)
(12:21:57 AM) Steveaccounting: (I'm from the real world)
(12:22:18 AM) DM_Meaty: (25 gold is a lot)
(12:22:29 AM) Foxwarrior: (well, it's like 25 pieces of good clothing or so)
(12:22:31 AM) Steveaccounting: "We would let you choose and go over the finances with your staff, yes?"
(12:23:40 AM) DM_Meaty: "Oh no, I don't have a staff. It's just me an my brother here. Once I have a castle built, I'll be able to set about everything else, but for now, I'm really no more important than a simple Lord"
(12:24:10 AM) Steveaccounting: (Is the gallery still up?)
(12:24:13 AM) DM_Meaty: "There only thing different is that my brother and I inherited a very large amount of wealth from our late father"
(12:24:24 AM) DM_Meaty: (The Gallery was closed yesterday)
(12:24:39 AM) DM_Meaty: (The two paintings are still there)
(12:24:54 AM) DM_Meaty: (there would have been 3, but Fox stabbed one with a bolt)
(12:25:06 AM) Steveaccounting: "You can come and see the paintings whenever it pleases you, sir."
(12:25:22 AM) Steveaccounting: "Of course we can just leave this one."
(12:25:50 AM) Steveaccounting: "Furthermore, one is of a more abstract type."
(12:26:41 AM) DM_Meaty: "Of course, and I'm sure whichever one I don't buy will then be sold to my brother"
(12:26:58 AM) Steveaccounting: "He offered, yes."
(12:27:40 AM) cup_of_joe left the room (quit: Quit: I'm totally still herzzzzzzzzzzz...).
(12:28:21 AM) DM_Meaty: "Then how about instead, you let my brother pick the one he wants to buy first"
(12:28:51 AM) Steveaccounting: "We'll be in touch."
(12:29:22 AM) Steveaccounting: And we leave
(12:29:42 AM) ***Foxwarrior leaves with Steve
(12:29:43 AM) Foxwarrior: "You forgot to ask about spells"
(12:30:00 AM) Steveaccounting: "We'll discuss that later."
(12:31:26 AM) Steveaccounting: And we leave and look for an agent of the S brother
(12:31:51 AM) DM_Meaty: (You find Subin at a table outside, eating)
(12:32:10 AM) DM_Meaty: (And I'll be right back cause I need to find something to eat. brb)
(12:33:24 AM) Foxwarrior: (seems that Steve's accountancy proclivities run deep)
(12:35:45 AM) Steveaccounting: (It's what the corporate grind does to you.
(12:36:11 AM) Foxwarrior: "Maybe we should offer to help Nibus 'restrain' his brother"
(12:36:32 AM) Steveaccounting: "How"
(12:37:07 AM) Foxwarrior: "Well, you tell him that maybe we could find a way"
(12:37:18 AM) Steveaccounting: "We can't"
(12:37:20 AM) DM_Meaty: (back)
(12:38:07 AM) DM_Meaty: "If you are done conniving behind my back, I assume you have a painting for me to buy?
(12:38:48 AM) Steveaccounting: "Absolutely, sir."
(12:39:21 AM) DM_Meaty: "hmm, my brother didn't buy anything?"
(12:39:53 AM) Steveaccounting: "We will discuss with him later, when his castle isn't falling appart."
(12:40:16 AM) Steveaccounting: "However he quite liked this one."
(12:40:21 AM) DM_Meaty: "Then I don't think you'll be selling him anything ever again"
(12:40:28 AM) Steveaccounting: And I show him the picture
(12:40:40 AM) DM_Meaty: "I'll buy both of them for 25 gold"
(12:41:05 AM) Steveaccounting: "Very well, sir."
(12:41:26 AM) Foxwarrior: "?"
(12:41:47 AM) ***Foxwarrior cocks his head at Steve
(12:41:47 AM) DM_Meaty: (he didn't say each steve. He said he'll pay 25 total)
(12:41:48 AM) Steveaccounting: "However we also had something else in mind."
(12:42:20 AM) Steveaccounting: "Would you consider giving some rudimentary magical training?"
(12:42:26 AM) Steveaccounting: "Not you personally of course."
(12:42:47 AM) Steveaccounting: "But it has caught our attention quite staggeringly."
(12:43:24 AM) DM_Meaty: "I don't mind taking on an apprentice, though the Good Magician is the one people typically go to for guidance."
(12:43:51 AM) Steveaccounting: "He has always been quite hard to find."
(12:43:54 AM) DM_Meaty: "Magical training is a rather hard task considering most rely on their magical talents in their day-to-day life
(12:44:57 AM) Steveaccounting: "We didn't come this far with laziness, sir."
(12:45:20 AM) DM_Meaty: "However, Mer, the first King of Xern, was quite the student of Magic. He had enormous libraries of spell books that he collected from years of research"
(12:45:43 AM) DM_Meaty: "Many people would sell their soul to a demon for the chance to get their hands on those books"
(12:46:06 AM) Steveaccounting: "And I imagine some have, sir."
(12:46:20 AM) DM_Meaty: (Subin smiles mischieviously)
(12:46:21 AM) ***Steveaccounting thinks of chicken wings and netflix
(12:47:39 AM) ***Steveaccounting goes ahead with the transactions and discusses the intricacies of apprenticeship
(12:48:01 AM) DM_Meaty: "How about a deal. I have recently gotten wind that one of Mer's own journals was uncovered in a nearby town"
(12:48:36 AM) DM_Meaty: "If you were to go and uncover this book, I will both pay you, and translate the text for the both of us"
(12:49:00 AM) Steveaccounting: "And the paintings, sir?"
(12:49:32 AM) DM_Meaty: "I believe i offered a price of 25 for the both of them, yes?
(12:49:48 AM) Steveaccounting: "You offered that, yes sir."
(12:50:49 AM) DM_Meaty: And I suppose I might as well offer up one spell to solidify the deal between us, yes?"
(12:51:28 AM) Steveaccounting: "That would be satisfactory, yes."
(12:51:56 AM) Steveaccounting: (for reference the character would have 3 cantrips and 3 spells by now (aproximately))
(12:52:32 AM) Steveaccounting: "Of course, additional spells would be helpful."
(12:53:05 AM) Steveaccounting: "In finding this book."
(12:53:16 AM) DM_Meaty: (Come with me to my study. I'm sure I can pull out a few texts that will serve you well)
(12:53:24 AM) Steveaccounting: We follow
(12:54:52 AM) DM_Meaty: (You spend the rest of the day learning some new spells from Subin, on the promise that tomorrow you will head off to look for the lost journal of Mer)
(12:55:09 AM) DM_Meaty: (What spells do you want to learn?)
(12:55:18 AM) Foxwarrior: (Fireball would be good, can I learn that?)
(12:55:29 AM) DM_Meaty: (no)
(12:55:59 AM) Steveaccounting: (warlock spell list inc)
(12:56:44 AM) Steveaccounting: (eldrich blast is a must, it's a cantrip (THE warlock cantrip))
(12:56:59 AM) ***Steveaccounting looks through spells, trying to find any that seem fit to her abilities
(12:57:57 AM) Steveaccounting: (Also Expeditious retreat and Hex)
(12:58:34 AM) Steveaccounting: (And if there's another cantrip avaiable prestidigitation)
(01:02:36 AM) DM_Meaty: …ok? (You all went quiet)
(01:02:58 AM) Steveaccounting: (Well is that all, can I have more, which do I get?)
(01:03:30 AM) ***Foxwarrior does his best to learn something by looking over Steve's shoulder
(01:04:15 AM) DM_Meaty: (Look, just pick 3 cantrips and 3 1st levels 
(01:04:49 AM) Steveaccounting: (Mage hand and armor of agathys)
(01:04:56 AM) Steveaccounting: *word documant making*
(01:04:58 AM) DM_Meaty: (ok)
(01:07:07 AM) DM_Meaty: (The day's done)
(01:07:14 AM) DM_Meaty: (Go to bed)
(01:07:16 AM) Steveaccounting: "Thank you, sir. We shall return with said book in due time."
(01:07:23 AM) ***Steveaccounting gets her own room
(01:07:59 AM) DM_Meaty: (ok, so you bought a room?)
(01:08:05 AM) DM_Meaty: (that's 1 gold per night)
(01:08:23 AM) ***Steveaccounting takes the 25 gold and pays w/ it
